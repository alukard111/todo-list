# todo-list
In this pet project, I tried to implement the calendar and the to-do list itself. In my free time, I will refine the layout in it and add some functionality to get more experience.

The project uses a tailwind css. I tried not to use libraries in order to get more development experience

To start the server - npm run serve!
